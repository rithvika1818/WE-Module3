# Yahtzee Code and Text Cases

## I am trying to write a python code to build a bot that helps me play the game yahtzee. What are the functions that I need to include?

Here are some functions you'll need for a Yahtzee bot in Python:

**1. Dice Rolling:**

- `roll_dice(num_dice)`: This function simulates rolling a specified number of dice (typically 5) and returns a list containing the rolled values. You can use the `random` module for this.

**2. Scoring:**

- `calculate_score(dice, category)`: This function takes the rolled dice (list) and a scoring category (string, e.g., "Full House") as input. It analyzes the dice and returns the score achieved for that category based on Yahtzee rules.

**3. Available Scores:**

- `get_available_scores(dice, used_scores)`: This function checks the rolled dice and a list of already used scoring categories. It returns a list of categories still available for scoring in this turn.

**4. Decision Making (AI):**

- `choose_best_score(dice, available_scores)`: This is the core AI function. It analyzes the rolled dice, available scoring options, and potentially considers remaining rolls and potential future scores. It then returns the category that offers the best scoring opportunity based on a chosen strategy (e.g., maximizing points, filling the scorecard strategically).

**5. User Interaction (Optional):**

- `get_user_choice(available_scores)`: If you want a semi-automated bot, this function can display the available scoring categories and prompt the user for their choice.

**Additional Functions:**

- `print_scorecard(scores)`: This function is for displaying the current Yahtzee scorecard with achieved scores for each category.

**Remember:**

- Implementing a good decision-making function requires understanding Yahtzee scoring strategies.
- You can find resources online that explain these strategies [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KNcbIehS_ZQ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KNcbIehS_ZQ).

These are the core functions to get you started. You can build upon them to create a more sophisticated Yahtzee bot!

## write the code for roll_dice(num_dice)

Here's the code for the `roll_dice(num_dice)` function in Python:

**Python**

`import random

def roll_dice(num_dice):
  """
  Simulates rolling a specified number of dice and returns a list containing the rolled values.

  Args:
      num_dice: The number of dice to roll (integer).

  Returns:
      A list of integers representing the rolled dice values.
  """
  return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(num_dice)]

# Example usage
dice_values = roll_dice(5)
print(dice_values)`

**Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**

This code does the following:

1. Imports the `random` module which provides functions for generating random numbers.
2. Defines a function `roll_dice` that takes an argument `num_dice` specifying the number of dice to roll.
3. Uses a list comprehension to generate a list of `num_dice` random integers between 1 and 6 (inclusive) using `random.randint`.
4. Returns the list of rolled dice values.

The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with `num_dice=5` and print the resulting list.

## write a code for calculate_score(dice, category)

Here's the code for the `calculate_score(dice, category)` function in Python:

**Python**

`def calculate_score(dice, category):
  """
  Calculates the score for a given category based on the rolled dice.

  Args:
      dice: A list of integers representing the rolled dice values.
      category: The scoring category (string, e.g., "Ones", "Full House").

  Returns:
      An integer representing the score achieved for the category, or 0 if the category is invalid.
  """
  category = category.upper()  # Ensure case-insensitive comparison
  if category == "ONES":
    return sum(die for die in dice if die == 1)
  elif category == "TWOS":
    return sum(die for die in dice if die == 2)
  # ... (similar logic for Threes, Fours, etc.)
  elif category == "FULL HOUSE":
    # Check for three of a kind and a pair
    three_kind = set(dice).pop() if len(set(dice)) == 2 else 0
    return sum(dice) if (three_kind and (dice.count(three_kind) == 3)) else 0
  elif category == "YAHTZEE":
    return 50 if all(die == dice[0] for die in dice) else 0
  # ... (similar logic for other categories)
  elif category == "CHANCE":
    return sum(dice)
  else:
    return 0  # Invalid category

# Example usage
dice = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]
score = calculate_score(dice, "Full House")
print(score)  # Output: 12`

**Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**

This code defines the `calculate_score` function:

1. It takes `dice` (list) and `category` (string) as arguments.
2. Converts `category` to uppercase for case-insensitive matching.
3. Uses a series of `if-elif` statements to check the category and calculate the score based on Yahtzee rules:
    - Sums dice values for categories like Ones, Twos, etc.
    - Checks for specific dice combinations for categories like Full House and Yahtzee.
    - Returns the sum of all dice for "Chance".
4. Returns 0 for invalid categories.

The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample dice roll and category, printing the achieved score.

**Note:** This code includes examples for just a few categories. You'll need to add similar logic for all Yahtzee scoring categories.

## choose_best_score(dice, available_scores)

Here's a possible implementation for the `choose_best_score(dice, available_scores)` function, employing a simple strategy that prioritizes high-scoring categories:

**Python**

`def choose_best_score(dice, available_scores):
  """
  Chooses the best scoring category from the available options.

  This implementation prioritizes higher-scoring categories (Yahtzee, Full House, Large Straight, etc.)

  Args:
      dice: A list of integers representing the rolled dice values.
      available_scores: A list of strings representing the available scoring categories.

  Returns:
      The category string from available_scores that offers the best scoring opportunity, 
      or None if no categories are available.
  """
  # Priority order for choosing categories (modify as needed)
  priority = ["YAHTZEE", "FULL HOUSE", "LARGE STRAIGHT", "SMALL STRAIGHT", 
              "FOUR OF A KIND", "THREE OF A KIND",  "ONES", "TWOS", "THREES", "FOURS", "FIVES", "SIXES", "CHANCE"]

  for category in priority:
    if category in available_scores:
      return category

  # No categories available from the priority list
  return None

# Example usage
dice = [2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
available_scores = ["YAHTZEE", "FULL HOUSE", "ONES"]
best_category = choose_best_score(dice, available_scores)
print(best_category)  # Output: FULL HOUSE (prioritizes over ONES)`

**Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**

This code defines the `choose_best_score` function:

1. It takes `dice` (list) and `available_scores` (list) as arguments.
2. Defines a `priority` list that orders Yahtzee categories by their potential score (you can adjust this order based on your strategy).
3. Iterates through the `priority` list.
4. For each category in the priority list, it checks if it's present in the `available_scores` list.
5. If an available category is found, it returns that category as the best choice.
6. If none of the prioritized categories are available, it returns `None`.

The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample dice roll, available categories, and printing the chosen category based on the priority list.

**Note:** This is a basic strategy. You can improve it by considering factors like the number of remaining rolls and potential future scoring opportunities.

## write a function for keeping track of score history

There are two main ways to track score history in Python for your Yahtzee bot:

**1. In-memory list:**

This method is simpler but only keeps track of scores within the current run of the program.

**Python**

`def update_score_history(score_history, score):
  """
  Updates the score history with a new score.

  Args:
      score_history: A list of integers representing past scores.
      score: The new score to add to the history (integer).

  Returns:
      The updated score history list.
  """
  score_history.append(score)
  return score_history

# Example usage
score_history = []
new_score = 42
score_history = update_score_history(score_history, new_score)
print(score_history)  # Output: [42]`

**Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**

This code defines an `update_score_history` function:

1. It takes `score_history` (list) and `score` (integer) as arguments.
2. Appends the new `score` to the `score_history` list.
3. Returns the updated `score_history`.

**2. Persisting data to a file:**

This method allows you to save the score history across program runs. You can use a CSV file or a text file for this purpose.

**Using CSV:**

**Python**

`import csv

def update_score_history_csv(filename, score):
  """
  Updates the score history by appending a new score to a CSV file.

  Args:
      filename: The name of the CSV file to store the history (string).
      score: The new score to add to the history (integer).
  """
  with open(filename, 'a', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow([score])

# Example usage
filename = 'yahtzee_scores.csv'
new_score = 50
update_score_history_csv(filename, new_score)`

**Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**

This code defines an `update_score_history_csv` function:

1. It takes `filename` (string) and `score` (integer) as arguments.
2. Opens the CSV file in append mode (`'a'`).
3. Creates a CSV writer object.
4. Writes a new row to the CSV with the `score` value.

**Using a text file (similar approach):**

**Python**

`def update_score_history_txt(filename, score):
  """
  Updates the score history by appending a new score to a text file.

  Args:
      filename: The name of the text file to store the history (string).
      score: The new score to add to the history (integer).
  """
  with open(filename, 'a') as f:
    f.write(str(score) + '\n')

# Example usage (similar to CSV function)`

**Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**

**Choosing the method:**

- If you only need to track scores within a single execution, the in-memory list is simpler.
- If you want to analyze scores across multiple game sessions, persisting data to a file is better. Choose CSV for a more structured format or a text file for a simpler approach.
